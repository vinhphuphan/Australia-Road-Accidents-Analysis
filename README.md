## Introduction
The "Australia Road Deaths Statistic Report Using Excel" provides a comprehensive analysis of road traffic fatalities in Australia, utilizing Excel's data analysis and visualization capabilities. 

This report aims to identify trends, factors, and regional disparities related to road accidents, offering valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in the field of road safety. By leveraging Excel's tools, this report presents key findings and evidence-based recommendations to reduce road fatalities and create safer roadways.

I have created a dynamic dashboard to visualise the data to gain the better insights of the trend and facts behind the scene. The data is collected until May 2023. Beside that, there are some precious findings that I present below :

## Findings

### Reduction Over Decade

<h4 align="center">Figure 1. The Trend of Road Accident Deaths over decade</h4>

In 2022, there were 1188 road crash deaths. The trend of fatalities in Australia's road accidents from 2010 to 2022 shows fluctuations and slight decreases.

### Regional Areas Experience Higher Road Accident Fatalities Compared to Major Cities

<h4 align="center">Figure 2.Annual Road Deaths By Remoteness</h4>

In 2022, Regional areas in Australia witness a higher number of road accident fatalities compared to major cities and remote locations, according to the provided data. The total number of fatalities recorded in regional areas amounted to 576, while major cities accounted for 352 fatalities.

### New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (Qld) Have the Highest Number of Road Accident Fatalities Among Australian States

<h4 align="center">Figure 3.Annual Road Deaths By State</h4>

New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (Qld) stand out as states with relatively higher road accident fatalities, accounting for 288 and 297 fatalities respectively, while other states and territories in Australia recorded comparatively lower numbers in 2022. 

### Drivers Account for Highest Number of Fatalities

<h4 align="center">Figure 4.Annual Road Deaths By Road User</h4>

We can observe that the highest number of fatalities in Australia's road accidents from 2010 to 2022 occurred among drivers, followed by motorcyclists and passengers.

### Age Groups 17-25 and 40-46 Most Vulnerable to Road Accident Fatalities, While Elderly Individuals Also at Risk
<p align="center"><img style="align: center;" src="https://github.com/vinhphuphan/Australia-Road-Accidents-Analysis/blob/main/images/By_Age_Group.png?raw=true" width=500></p>
<h4 align="center">Figure 5.Annual Road Deaths By Age Group</h4>

In 2022, Young adults between the ages of 17-25 and middle-aged individuals in the 40-46 age range are disproportionately affected by road accident fatalities, with 230 and 375 recorded fatalities respectively. Additionally, individuals aged 65-74 and those over 75 years old account for 114 and 136 fatalities respectively.

### Road Accident Fatalities Show a Higher Frequency in Afternoon and Evening Hours, While Nighttime Records Fewer Fatalities
<p align="center"><img style="align: center;" src="https://github.com/vinhphuphan/Australia-Road-Accidents-Analysis/blob/main/images/By_Time.png?raw=true" width=500></p>
<h4 align="center">Figure 6.Annual Road Deaths By Time of Day</h4>

Based on the above figure, road accident fatalities exhibit a higher occurrence during the afternoon and evening hours, with 523 and 316 recorded fatalities respectively in 2022. In contrast, the night hours from 10 pm to 6 am indicate a comparatively lower number of fatalities, with 85 recorded cases.

### Speed Limits Impact Road Accident Fatalities: Higher Speed Ranges Show Increased Fatality Numbers
<p align="center"><img style="align: center;" src="https://github.com/vinhphuphan/Australia-Road-Accidents-Analysis/blob/main/images/By_Speed_Limit.png?raw=true" width=500></p>
<h4 align="center">Figure 7.Annual Road Deaths By Speed Limit</h4>

Road accident fatalities exhibit a notable increase as speed limits escalate, with higher fatality numbers observed at speeds exceeding 80 km/hr. Speeds ranging from 100 km/hr to ≥ 110 km/hr record the highest number of fatalities, amounting to 369 and 153 respectively, while lower speed limits of ≤ 40 km/hr and 50 km/hr demonstrate relatively lower fatality counts of 20 and 116.
